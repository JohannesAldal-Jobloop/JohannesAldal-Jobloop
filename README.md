# Hallo! Eg heiter Johannes
Hallo! Eg heiter Johannes, og eg elskar √• lage ting. Det kan vere videospel, program, LEGO, 3D-modellering eller 3D-utskrift. Eg vart interessert i utvikling d√• eg inns√•g at videospela eg spelte vart laga av nokon, og det betydde at eg og kunne lage dei. Difor jobbar eg hardt med √• bli utviklar.
Eg har erfaring med C#, Python, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, HTML og CSS. For meir spesifikke detaljar om utdanning og erfaring, sj√• min [CV](https://github.com/JohannesAldal-Jobloop/JohannesAldal-Jobloop/blob/main/Johannes_Aldal_CV%20(1).pdf).

# Hello! My name is Johannes
Hello! My name is Johannes, and I love making stuff. That be videogames, programs, LEGO, 3D-modeling, or 3D-printing. I became interested in development when I realized that the videogames I was playing were made by someone, and that meant that I too could make them. Therefore, I work hard to become a developer.
I have experience with C#, Python, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, HTML, and CSS. For more specific details about my education and experience, see my [CV](https://github.com/JohannesAldal-Jobloop/JohannesAldal-Jobloop/blob/main/Johannes_Aldal_CV%20(1).pdf) (in Norwegian).

## Unity
I have most experince in Unity and I have created a smal game with it witch you can find on [Unity play](https://play.unity.com/mg/other/omringa-v1-00-final) and [itch.io](https://gottejos.itch.io/omringa)
I also have a personal Unity project that I called [Leikekassa4](https://github.com/JohannesAldal-Jobloop/Leikekassa4) (Playground4), where I just create game mechanics without a spesific game in mind. I just use it to practice Unity.

## Windows forms app
I realy like maing stuff in Winforms, I think the ease of making the visuals for the app and how easy it is to use them in code makes it easy to work in. I have a [project](https://github.com/JohannesAldal-Jobloop/ClickerGameWFA) where im making many games in one app. I have made a simple clikker game, copied the memmory game from Microsofts learn, a Snake copy and i have started on a Tetris clone and a Pong clone.

## 3D modeling and 3D printing 
I have 3D modeling and 3D printing as a hobby. I have love how the macine works, what it can do and that I can make all I want. I have made my own models that I have printed too. You can find my designes I have relesed publicly on [Cults3D](https://cults3d.com/en/users/Gottejos/3d-models).
