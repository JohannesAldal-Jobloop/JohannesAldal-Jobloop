# Hello my name is Johannes Aldal and i love making stuff.

I have experience in C#, python, JavaScript, php, mysql, html and css.
For more spesifics on my education see my [CV](https://github.com/JohannesAldal-Jobloop/JohannesAldal-Jobloop/blob/main/Johannes_Aldal_CV%20(1).pdf).

## Unity
I have most experince in Unity and I have created a smal game with it witch you can find on [Unity play](https://play.unity.com/mg/other/omringa-v1-00-final) and [itch.io](https://gottejos.itch.io/omringa)
I also have a personal Unity project that I called [Leikekassa4](https://github.com/JohannesAldal-Jobloop/Leikekassa4) (Playground4), where I just create game mechanics without a spesific game in mind. I just use it to practice Unity.

## Windows forms app
I realy like maing stuff in Winforms, I think the ease of making the visuals for the app and how easy it is to use them in code makes it easy to work in. I have a [project](https://github.com/JohannesAldal-Jobloop/ClickerGameWFA) where im making many games in one app. I have made a simple clikker game, copied the memmory game from Microsofts learn, a Snake copy and i have started on a Tetris clone and a Pong clone.
